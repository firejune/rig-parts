/**
 * The motion gate of the automatic mesh mode (`src/automotion.ts`, issue #126
 * item 3) over the public examples, by one command:
 *
 *     bun run fetch-examples          # once: examples/{demo,sample,scarf}/inputs
 *     bun tools/auto_motion_survey.ts
 *
 * Which parts: the eight that item 2 accepted on geometry (issue #126, the
 * item-2 comment: demo `neck`, `bottomwear`; sample `neck`, `sleeves`,
 * `topwear`, `bottomwear`; scarf `hair_front`, `handwear_l`), each switched
 * **alone** to `auto` in its example's own config. The policy, stated before
 * any comparison ran and not tuned per part: `examplePolicy(spacing)`
 * (`fixtures/automesh.ts`, with the part's tracked spacing — its lattice
 * `grid`, or the contour spacing of a part already in that mode) plus
 * `policyMotion` (`fixtures/automotion.ts`: `maxLocalDeformation` = the
 * policy's `maxBoundaryDeviation`, no stretch bounds, no `deformMayFold`).
 *
 * What runs: `assembleStage` on the example's fetched inputs, then the real
 * `rigStage` — the gate build, the reference build and rig-c's
 * `compareMeshesInMotion` — through the installed rigc, in a temporary
 * directory that is removed afterwards. The stage's verdict decides the
 * verdict column; the rows of a refused part, which the stage does not write,
 * are read from the same comparison re-run on the two model documents the
 * stage's builds wrote (the stage's own function, `runComparison`), and the
 * tool refuses to print a row whose re-run verdict disagrees with the
 * stage's. The case is rebuilt by `buildRig` with the stage's own reduction
 * handed back (`reuseReductions`, keyed by the whole input), so each part's
 * `reduceMesh` runs once (issue #135). One part's run is {@link motionCell},
 * which `tools/auto_weightjump_survey.ts` runs too.
 *
 * Since rig-c 2.24.0 the stage runs the acceptance loop (`src/autoreplay.ts`)
 * on a part whose full result the gate refuses: the first table stays the full
 * result's comparison (the stage's first two builds), and a second table reads
 * the loop off the row the stage wrote (`replay`) or off its refusal.
 *
 * ## `--config <name>[,<name>…]`: the Stage B matrix (rigc#1271, rig-c 2.25.0–2.28.0)
 *
 * With `--config`, each named configuration ({@link STAGE_B_CONFIGS}) is run
 * over the same eight parts — the policy above plus that configuration's
 * opt-ins and nothing else — and one document is printed: per part and
 * configuration, the source, full and chosen counts, the operations N (I),
 * the chosen step, the replays and the candidates of the full run and of the
 * replays, the full run's termination, the chosen row's
 * `MQ_BOUNDARY_DEVIATION`, the motion readings with their worst frames, the
 * verdict, what each opt-in did, and the five allocation rows rig-c 2.26.0
 * added — with, since rig-c 2.29.0, the load measured under the derived
 * amplitude (gradation null), economy E beside Δ, and the comparison's setup
 * load on the source and the full result. `baseline` is no opt-in: the same
 * calls as the default document. `gradation` is the baseline with
 * `motion.gradation` 0.75, the one value rig-c's contract names, so Δ and E
 * appear once; it is an author's number written for the evidence, no default.
 *
 * `residual` and `allResidual` (rig-c 2.31.0, rigc#1295) are the baseline and `all` with
 * `motion.residual.maxResidual` 1; with either, a third table prints per part whether the envelope
 * was sent (or every stop that left it not measurable), the envelope, the steps the veto refused on
 * the full run (`tools/veto_tally.ts`, which re-runs that run's own input after the stage's wall time
 * was taken), the written mesh's `MQ_SKINNING_RESIDUAL` with its worst sample, and the comparison.
 *
 * Output: Markdown — two tables, one schedule line per part, and the refusal
 * text of every refused part. Every number is read from rig-c's report;
 * no path, no time and no machine is printed, so two runs of one tree print
 * the same bytes. Each part's wall time and rigc build count go to standard
 * error instead. Exit 1 when an example's inputs are missing (it names
 * them) or a re-run disagrees with the stage; 0 otherwise, refused parts
 * included — a refusal is a result.
