/**
 * The evaluation matrix of the automatic mesh mode (issue #126, items 4-5),
 * written to `docs/evidence/auto-mesh-matrix.md` by one command so it can be
 * regenerated when rig-c moves:
 *
 *     bun tools/auto_matrix.ts --work <dir> [--out <file.md>] [--examples <key>,...]
 *                              [--no-builds] [--no-timing] [--quiet-wait <s>]
 *
 * Every figure in the document is written by this tool; none is typed. What it
 * measures, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Timing** (the owner's condition 4), before anything else loads the
 *    machine: the inputs of the #131 timing rows — demo `bottomwear`, sample
 *    `sleeves` and `bottomwear`, scarf `handwear_l` under the strict policy,
 *    weighted exactly as the rig stage weights them, and the synthetic strip
 *    with its region — each timed by a wrapper around rig-c's exported
 *    `measureMeshQuality` (the source measured once, three times) and around
 *    `reduceMesh` (twice), with `uptime` read before and after each. A figure
 *    is labelled quiet only when both one-minute load averages are under 2
 *    ({@link quietLabel}). Nothing inside rig-c is instrumented, so the
 *    granularity is those two calls.
 * 2. **Synthetic rows**: the cases of `fixtures/automesh.ts` under the
 *    synthetic policy and its permissive twin, geometry only (unweighted).
 * 3. **Example rows**: every mesh part of every fetched public example, under
 *    the strict policy (`examplePolicy`, #131's, unchanged) and the permissive
 *    one (`permissivePolicy`), each part switched alone. Per row the three
 *    counts — (a) the tracked mesh, (b) the automatic mode's unreduced source,
 *    (c) the result — the residuals rig-c reports at alpha 1 and above,
 *    the loss figure ({@link lossAgainstOriginal}: art pixels at alpha 1 and
 *    above the mesh leaves uncovered, read against the ORIGINAL padded image,
 *    specks included), the termination, the verdict ({@link classify}), and for
 *    an accepted part the full `rig` + `check` with the part switched alone; then
 *    one more build per example and policy with every accepted part switched.
 *    The rig stage's own `mesh_report.json` row is held to this tool's direct
 *    call (counts and candidates tried), so both read the same inputs.
 * 4. **The region condition**: the skirt parts (`bottomwear`) with the
 *    declared region of `matrixRegion` (fixtures/automesh.ts) on the circle
 *    `tools/real_compare.ts`'s `testRegion` rule places, under both policies.
 * 5. **#115 on `sample/sleeves`**: the alpha threshold separated from the
 *    weighting rule — the unreduced auto source at alpha 1 and above, with and
 *    without the 0.03 floor, at tolerance 1 and 0.5, beside the contour mode
 *    at alpha above 8 (whose weights carry the 0.03 floor), each switched alone
 *    and read off `check`'s `TEXTURE_STRETCH` row for the part.
 *
 * `--work` holds the builds (`base-<key>`, the tracked build each variant
 * reads its parts from) and every variant's config, so a row can be re-run by
 * hand. `--no-builds` and `--no-timing` leave those sections out and say so in
 * the document. `--cell <part>:<strict|permissive>` runs that one row of each
 * named example and nothing else (no synthetic rows, no region condition, no
 * switched-at-once build, no #115 variants), and the document says so.
 * Timing is the one clock this repository's tools read, and is not a claim
 * about another machine.
 *
 * **What the run costs** (issue #135): the stages run in this process —
 * `build` for a tracked example, then `rigStage` and `checkStage` for every
 * variant — through one counting rigc runner, so the document's header states
 * the run's wall time, every rigc call by kind, and every `reduceMesh` call by
 * who made it. A variant's rig stage is handed `reuseReductions` over the
 * reductions this tool's geometry rows already ran, keyed by the whole input
 * (`reductionKey`): an accepted part's reduction runs once, in its geometry
 * row, and the stage reuses it; an input no row ran (a #115 variant with
 * budget 0) is run by the stage and counted as the stage's.
