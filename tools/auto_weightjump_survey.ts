/**
 * rigc#1266 Q7, measured on the public examples: `protect.weightJump` on the
 * parts the automatic mode's motion gate refuses under the stated policy, by
 * one command:
 *
 *     bun run fetch-examples          # once: examples/{demo,sample}/inputs
 *     bun tools/auto_weightjump_survey.ts > docs/evidence/auto-motion-weightjump.md
 *
 * Which parts: the three `docs/evidence/auto-motion-survey.md` records as
 * refused `AUTO_MESH_MOTION` — demo `bottomwear`, sample `sleeves`, sample
 * `bottomwear` — each switched **alone** to `auto` in its example's own
 * config, under exactly the motion survey's policy
 * (`withPolicyMotion(examplePolicy(spacing))`, `fixtures/automesh.ts` and
 * `fixtures/automotion.ts`) and nothing else changed but `protect.weightJump`.
 *
 * **The largest source edge jump**, as rig-c's `MQ79` derives it (rig-c's
 * `selftest.ts`, `mvEdgeJump`; {@link edgeJumps} reproduces it): over every
 * edge of every source triangle, the L1 difference of the two endpoints'
 * weight vectors over the bones they name — `protect.weightJump`'s own
 * measure (`weightJump`, rig-c `src/meshreduce.ts`) — read on the source
 * exactly as the rig stage hands it to `reduceMesh` (`input.source.weights`:
 * `localInfluences` under the policy's influences, unrounded). It is read off
 * the stated-policy run's own input, so no pose and no comparison chose it.
 *
 * The rules, one per run, every one derived from that figure J and none from
 * a comparison: `none` (the stated policy: the motion survey's run, repeated
 * here so its row sits beside the others); `x1.1` — just above J, J × 1.1
 * rounded UP to 6 decimals ({@link ruleValue}), the same rule for every part;
 * `x1.5` — the contract's reproducer's (`MQ79`: 1.5 × J), rounded up the same
 * way; `= J` — J exactly, the double itself. rig-c protects a source edge
 * whose jump is ABOVE the value and refuses a step adding an edge whose jump
 * is above it, so at `= J` no source edge is protected by condition (a).
 *
 * What runs per (part, rule): `motionCell` (`tools/auto_motion_survey.ts`) —
 * the real rig stage, its gate build, reference build and rig-c's
 * `compareMeshesInMotion`, through the installed rigc, in a temporary
 * directory removed afterwards. The schedule's selection is empty, so every
 * frame is held out: no value here was chosen by looking at a frame.
 *
 * Output: Markdown. Every number is read from rig-c's report or computed by
 * {@link edgeJumps} from the input the stage made; no path, no time and no
 * machine is printed, so two runs of one tree print the same bytes. Exit 1 when
 * an example's inputs are missing or a re-run comparison disagrees with the
 * stage; 0 otherwise — a refusal is a result.
