/**
 * How many steps rig-c's skinning-residual veto refused in one reduction
 * (issue #126, rig-c 2.31.0, rigc#1295). rig-c's report does not carry the
 * count: `changes.acceptedAt` lists the operations taken, the termination the
 * last refusal, and `changes.retriangulation.refusedBy` the post-pass's. So
 * this tool re-runs the very input through `reduceMeshWith` — on `rig-c/mesh`
 * by `export *` and documented there as *internal, not promised* — with an
 * attempt observer, and counts the removal-phase attempts whose refusal is
 * named `MQ_SKINNING_RESIDUAL`. `reduceMeshWith` over the input's own rasters
 * is `reduceMesh` for that input byte for byte (rig-c's own words); the tally
 * checks that here — the report's text and the mesh against `reduceMesh`'s —
 * and refuses to count when they differ, so a count never describes a
 * reduction other than the one the stage ran.
 *
 * A tool and a control's instrument, never the rig stage's: `src/` stays on
 * rig-c's promised surface, and the row says the count is not in rig-c's
 * report rather than carrying it.
