/**
 * The head-box proposer: `seethrough.head_box`, the square crop of the source
 * painting the second, head-only See-through run is fed, read off the FULL
 * run's layers.
 *
 * The rule is the reference's (`gen_painting.py --propose-head-box`): take the
 * union of the `face`, `back hair`, `front hair`, `headwear` and `earwear`
 * layers after the ghost clean-up, cut it off 0.35 face heights below the chin
 * (a long lock must not drag the box down), add a 12 % margin, square it on
 * the union's centre, and map it from the full run's canvas to source pixels
 * through the run's own pad (`squarePad`: the source is centred on a square of
 * its longer side, so a portrait painting's x carries the pad and a landscape
 * one's y does; the reference took x only, its paintings being portrait).
 *
 * Two departures, both because the reference's box could not be fed back in:
 *
 * - 🔲 **The box is square by construction.** The reference rounded each edge
 *   on its own, so the two sides could come out a pixel apart (measured: 3 of
 *   the reference's 10 corpus boxes, e.g. 502x503), and the config loader
 *   refuses a non-square head box. Here the near edges are rounded as the
 *   reference rounds them and the side is the larger of its two rounded
 *   extents: square, never smaller than the reference's box, and equal to it
 *   wherever that was already square.
 * - 📐 **The box is held inside the painting.** The reference's box on the
 *   public `demo` character started 118 px above the canvas, and the crop
 *   filled that band with black, which See-through then decomposed. A box that
 *   leaves the canvas is shifted back inside at the same size, and the shift is
 *   reported; a box larger than the painting's short side cannot be held
 *   inside at that size and is refused.
