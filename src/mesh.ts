/**
 * The lattice mesh: one square grid over a part, every cell that holds an art
 * pixel kept as two triangles, so the mesh covers 100 % of the art by
 * construction.
 *
 * Ported from the reference implementation's `build_mesh` / `one_loop`. What
 * it does, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Cells.** A grid of `grid`-pixel squares over the (padded) part image;
 *    the last column and row are clipped to the image. A cell is kept when any
 *    pixel inside it has alpha above {@link ART_ALPHA}.
 * 2. **One loop.** rig-c refuses a mesh whose triangles' outline is not
 *    one closed loop, and a See-through layer is often two islands (a hairpin
 *    head and its tassel) or has a hole. So the kept cells are made one
 *    simply-connected region: holes filled (`scipy.ndimage.binary_fill_holes`,
 *    `fillHoles` here), every other 4-connected island bridged to the largest
 *    by a straight run of cells, and every diagonal pinch filled. The extra
 *    cells hold no art and draw nothing. The reference stopped after
 *    {@link ONE_LOOP_PASSES} passes and returned whatever it had; this port
 *    then CHECKS the outline and refuses a lattice that is still not one loop
 *    (`RIG_LATTICE_ONE_LOOP`), rather than hand rigc a mesh it would refuse
 *    with less to say about why.
 * 3. **Triangles.** Vertices are numbered in the order the kept cells first
 *    touch them (row-major cells, corners top-left, top-right, bottom-right,
 *    bottom-left); each cell is two triangles with the diagonal alternating by
 *    `(i + j) % 2` so the lattice has no preferred shear. Each triangle is
 *    built clockwise on screen (top-left, top-right, bottom-right), the
 *    reference's order, and written with its last two corners swapped
 *    ({@link counterClockwiseInSpineWorld}): the y flip to Spine's world does
 *    not turn a loop over, so a triangle clockwise on screen is clockwise in
 *    Spine world, and the winding rig-c reads a mesh in is
 *    counter-clockwise there (issue #126; rigc#1236). The swap is made after
 *    the boundary walk below, so no vertex index and no hull moves with it.
 * 4. **Boundary first.** Spine's `hull` is a count: the first `hull` vertices
 *    are the outline, in order. The outline is walked from the edges used by
 *    exactly one triangle, then every interior vertex follows in index order.
 * 5. **Coverage.** Every triangle is rasterised (`cv2.fillPoly`, `fillPoly`
 *    here) and the fraction of art pixels it covers is reported. By
 *    construction it is 1; it is measured anyway, because a claim that holds
 *    by construction is exactly the kind nobody re-reads.
 *
 * Every tie and every scan order above is the reference's, because each one
 * decides a vertex index, and a vertex index is what a weight is written
 * against.
