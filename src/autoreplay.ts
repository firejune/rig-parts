/**
 * The automatic mode's acceptance loop with a replay (issue #126, rigc#1266
 * mechanism 2, rig-c 2.24.0): what the rig stage does with an `auto` part
 * whose full reduction is refused by the motion gate (`src/automotion.ts`).
 *
 * rig-c's `reduceMesh` reports `changes.acceptedAt`, one entry per accepted
 * operation — `{ step, kind, count, sourceVertices }`, `step` the attempt
 * number it was taken at and `kind` a refinement `insertion`, a single
 * `removal` or a `boundary-run` (from rig-c 2.25.0, rigc#1279; before it the
 * entries were the bare attempt numbers) — and takes `stopAfterAccepted: n`,
 * which returns byte for byte the mesh the same call held after its n-th
 * accepted operation, terminated `replayed-to-accepted-step` (the contract:
 * rig-c's docs/MESH_REDUCTION.md §2 and §7, *Mechanism 2 — implemented*).
 * Every step below is an operation, not a vertex: a boundary run removes two
 * or more vertices in one step. The choosing is this package's (mechanism 3,
 * agreed on issue #126 as Q8), and it is done this way:
 *
 * 1. **The domain.** N = `acceptedAt.length` operations; the first I of them
 *    are the refinement's insertions ({@link refinementSteps}: the entries up
 *    to the last of kind `insertion` — rig-c refines inside the declared
 *    regions, then removes). A step at or below I is the
 *    source, refined or not, and is never written as an automatic result —
 *    writing the source would silently defeat the mode, so a search that finds
 *    no removal step passing is refused, "no reduction passes the motion
 *    bound" ({@link noReductionProblem}). Step N is the full result, which the
 *    gate already refused. So only the removal steps I+1 .. N−1 are probed, and
 *    a replay inside the refinement — which rig-c returns unaccepted, a
 *    refinement step not being required to meet the targets — is never asked
 *    for.
 * 2. **The search** ({@link bisectAccepted}): a bisection on n over (I, N),
 *    lo = I taken as passing and hi = N as failing; each probe replays step
 *    n, holds it to the same acceptance as the full result ({@link
 *    replayVerdict}: the termination rig-c promised, every declared geometry
 *    row passing), compiles it and compares it with the source on the idle's
 *    **grid** frames only ({@link selectionSchedule}: the schedule walks no
 *    irr frame at all, so none can inform the choice). It keeps the largest n
 *    it saw pass. Validity along the order is not monotone (the contract's M3
 *    measured it), so the search finds *a* passing prefix by bisection, not
 *    necessarily the last, and the row says so ({@link REPLAY_RULE}). Its
 *    length is at most ⌈log₂(N − I)⌉ replays ({@link maxReplays}) — derived
 *    from the domain, not an author's number; no config knob exists.
 * 3. **The acceptance.** The chosen replay is written into the rig, which goes
 *    through rigc's gate again as written, and is compared with the source on
 *    the whole idle — grid and irr — with the grid frames declared
 *    `selection` and the irr frames held out ({@link splitSchedule};
 *    `heldOutClaim` true, by rig-c's walk). It is accepted only when rig-c's
 *    verdict is `accepted` on every frame, the held-out ones included;
 *    otherwise {@link heldOutProblem} names the selection value and the held-out
 *    value with the worst frame of each. Nothing is written otherwise.
 *
 * The probe — a replay, a build, a comparison — runs in the rig stage
 * (`src/build.ts`), the one place this package runs rigc. Pure: no clock, no
 * randomness, nothing read or written.
