/**
 * The skinning envelope of an automatic part (issue #126 Q3–Q5, rig-c 2.31.0
 * `targets.skinning`, rigc#1294/#1295): what rig-c's `MQ_SKINNING_RESIDUAL`
 * reads, and, when the author sets `meshes.<part>.auto.motion.residual`, what
 * every removal, boundary run and post-pass of `reduceMesh` is held to. Its
 * own module rather than inside `src/autoamplitude.ts`: the amplitude is a
 * pair-wise θ per track and stops the whole rig on any constraint, while the
 * envelope is per bone, composed by rig-c's helper, and stops only the parts
 * whose chains a constraint drives. Both read the same idle.
 *
 * The contract (rig-c docs/MESH_REDUCTION.md §7, *Mechanism 1 — implemented,
 * the measurement half* and *the reducer half*) types it as
 *
 *     { reference, bones: [{ bone, linear, pivot, translation }] }
 *
 * and every entry comes from rig-c's `skinningEnvelopeBone({ referenceChain,
 * chain })` — rig-c's one definition of `linear` (Q3) — over ranges read off
 * the idle this package writes. Nothing is estimated here.
 *
 * ## The terms
 *
 * - **The reference** is the slot's bone (Q4): the bone the rig stage writes
 *   on the part's slot, `segments[0]`'s bone.
 * - **The bones** are every bone the part's source weights bind, other than
 *   the reference, sorted — "every bone either mesh binds, other than
 *   `reference`, once each"; a reduced mesh binds no bone its source does not
 *   (survivors keep their shares, an insertion interpolates them).
 * - **The chains**: `referenceChain` is the rig's ancestry from the root down
 *   to the reference; `chain` from the reference's child down to the bone,
 *   parents first — read off the rig's bones as written, controls included.
 *   A bound bone that is not below the reference has no such chain, and the
 *   helper composes no other: the part's residual is not measurable, naming
 *   the bone (`ENVELOPE_BONE_NOT_BELOW_REFERENCE`).
 * - **Each bone's range** (`BoneMotionRange`) from the idle's tracks that key
 *   it — its own track or a group's that names it: `rotate` the [min, max]
 *   of every key value and every Bézier control value (a cubic Bézier lies
 *   inside the hull of its control points; a named easing runs between its
 *   two key values, and both easings this package writes stay within
 *   [0, 1]), `scaleX` / `scaleY` the same over `scalex` / `scaley`, and
 *   `translate` the length of (max |translatex|, max |translatey|) — each a
 *   value Spine adds to (rotation, translation) or multiplies (scale) the
 *   setup by; an unkeyed property is [0, 0], [1, 1] or 0. `pivot` is the
 *   bone's setup joint in the part's drawing frame (crop px less the part's
 *   padded origin, y down). `setup` is the rig's as written: this package
 *   writes no bone scale, shear or inherit mode, so `{ 1, 1, 0, 0, 'normal' }`.
 *   A shear key has no field in `BoneMotionRange`, so a bone keyed by one
 *   makes the residual not measurable (`ENVELOPE_SHEAR_KEYED`); a property
 *   the idle writes and none of the above names is refused the same way.
 * - **Constraints**: a bone a constraint drives — an ik's, a transform's or a
 *   path's `bones`, a physics constraint's `bone` — moves by what the
 *   constraint solves, not by a key. Its range is handed to rig-c with the
 *   constraint's kind as its `source`, and rig-c refuses it by name
 *   (`SKINNING_RANGE_UNSUPPORTED`): rig-c certifies only ranges declared by
 *   keys and exposes no physics range off a posed walk (Q3), so none is
 *   invented here. A slider drives the bones of an animation this module does
 *   not read, so a rig with a slider makes every part's residual not
 *   measurable (`ENVELOPE_SLIDER_UNREAD`).
 *
 * A part with any stop is **not measurable**: no `targets.skinning` is sent,
 * the veto is not applied, and the motion comparison accepts or refuses the
 * part alone, as it does without the field. Every stop is named — bone, code
 * and rig-c's own words where rig-c refused.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no randomness, nothing read or written.
