/**
 * The motion amplitude of an automatic part (issue #126 Q2, rig-c 2.26.0 /
 * 2.29.0 `motionAmplitude`): what rig-c's two weight-aware allocation rows —
 * `MQ_ALLOCATION_CONTRAST` and `MQ_DEFORM_LOAD` — read. The tracks are derived
 * from the motion this package already declares and never written by the
 * author; the gradation is the author's number or null. rig-c's contract
 * (docs/MESH_REDUCTION.md §8, *Implemented — the allocation rows* and *G —
 * what it derives from*) types it as
 *
 *     { tracks: [{ track, pairs: [{ bones, theta }], epsilon }], gradation?: number | null }
 *
 * and every derived term is derived here or refused by name; none is guessed.
 *
 * ## The terms
 *
 * - **A track** is one track of the idle as the rig stage writes it
 *   (`MotionSpec`, after the control bones took their keys), named
 *   `<bone or group>.<property>#<index>`, the index its place in the idle.
 * - **The pairs** are every unordered pair of the bones the part's source
 *   weights bind (sorted), declared in every track that moves at least one of
 *   them relative to another — so no pair a share can move between is left
 *   undeclared, which would leave both rows `not-measurable` (§8: "a pair no
 *   track declares makes both rows not-measurable"). A track moves bone `b`
 *   when a bone it keys is `b` or an ancestor of `b`: Spine bones inherit
 *   their parent's rotation and scale (the rig writes no inherit mode), so a
 *   pair the track moves together — both under one keyed bone — or not at all
 *   keeps its relative linear part, θ 0 (§8: "a bone that does not move is
 *   declared with θ 0"); a pair it moves on one side only gets the track's θ.
 *   A pair moved by two different bones of one group (the blink's `eyes`) has a
 *   relative part that depends on the two bones' frames, which this module does
 *   not compose: it is refused by name.
 * - **θ** = ‖M − I‖ of the pair's relative linear part over the track (§8),
 *   bounded from the track's keys: rig-c's formulas — 2 sin(α / 2) for a
 *   rotation by α, |s − 1| for a scale by s — at the largest |value| (rotate,
 *   degrees, a value Spine adds to the setup rotation) or the value furthest
 *   from 1 (scale, a factor on the setup scale, which the rig writes as 1) over
 *   every key value and every Bézier control value of the track. A cubic Bézier
 *   lies inside the hull of its control points, so this bounds the curve
 *   between keys (it may exceed the sine's true peak by the handles' overshoot;
 *   it never falls short); a named easing (`shut`, `open`) runs between its two
 *   key values. A scale along one axis is a diagonal map, and |s − 1| is its
 *   norm. A translation leaves the linear part unchanged: θ 0 by the contract's
 *   definition. ⚠️ So a pair a translation separates carries no load in rig-c's
 *   reading — the contract's θ has no lever term (§8's correction names it) —
 *   and that is rig-c's definition, not a figure measured here. A shear is
 *   refused: the contract gives no formula for it and this module invents none.
 * - **ε**, drawing px, above 0: the chord error a track tolerates. The one
 *   number the part declares for how far motion may carry art is its motion
 *   bound, `meshes.<part>.auto.motion.maxLocalDeformation` (rig px = drawing
 *   px: the rig's images are the drawing, `pageScale` 1), and it is read as
 *   every track's ε. A bound of 0 is not above 0 and is refused by name.
 * - **G**, `gradation`, px per px: how fast the mesh may coarsen away from
 *   something that needs density (§8, read by `MQ_ALLOCATION_CONTRAST` only).
 *   rig-c measured that nothing a rig declares fixes it (rigc#1291, *G — what
 *   it derives from*), so it is **the author's**:
 *   `meshes.<part>.auto.motion.gradation`, sent as written, and `null` when
 *   the author left it out — rig-c 2.29.0 then measures `MQ_DEFORM_LOAD`, which
 *   never read G, and reads `MQ_ALLOCATION_CONTRAST` `not-measurable` naming
 *   the gradation. No value is derived or defaulted here.
 * - **Constraints** move bones by what they solve, not by a key: a rig with
 *   any constraint is refused by name, because no declared amplitude bounds
 *   what a constraint does.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no randomness, nothing read or written.
