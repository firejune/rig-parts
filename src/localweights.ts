/**
 * Local deformation regions' weights (issue #84, step 2): a declared region
 * takes a share of a vertex for its own control bone, and the rest of the
 * vertex is shared among the mesh's segment bones by `influences()`
 * (`src/weights.ts`) exactly as the lattice shares it.
 *
 * ## The falloff, as a definition
 *
 * A region's bone takes the weight
 *
 *     g = 1                      inside the region (its boundary included)
 *     g = 1 − d / band           at a distance d from the region, 0 < d < band
 *     g = 0                      at d ≥ band (for band 0: everywhere outside)
 *
 * where d is the Euclidean distance to the circle (|p − c| − r) or to the
 * nearest point of the polygon's edges. That is the declared falloff — linear,
 * no smoothstep, no tuned curve. The two decisions that are not a value in
 * between — "inside" (g = 1) and "at or past the band" (g = 0) — are made
 * EXACTLY: every region number is a multiple of 1/256 px (the config loader
 * refuses anything else) and every vertex this package writes is too
 * (`src/contour.ts`'s grid, moved by a whole-pixel offset), so both run on
 * integers — squared distances compared without a square root, the polygon's
 * inside by the crossing rule on integer orientations, its distance to an edge
 * compared squared in `BigInt`. Only a value strictly in between is computed
 * in doubles (`Math.sqrt` and the reference's segment arithmetic), and it is
 * clamped to [0, 1].
 *
 * ## The vertex's weights (see {@link localInfluences})
 *
 * With `S = influences(p, segments, r, limits)` — today's, unchanged. The
 * cap and the floor are `limits`: `MAX_INFLUENCES` (4) and `MIN_WEIGHT`
 * (0.03) for the contour mode, the author's `influences` for the automatic
 * mode (issue #126, P19):
 *
 * - **no region reaches the vertex** (every g = 0): the weights are `S`, and
 *   the rig stage rounds them exactly as the lattice does — a contour mesh
 *   with no region is weighted as the lattice would weight the same points;
 * - **g = 1**: the region's bone alone, weight 1;
 * - **0 < g < 1**: the region's bone takes g and the segment bones share
 *   1 − g in `S`'s proportions. A region bone that is also a segment bone
 *   takes g + (1 − g)·S(bone), one entry. **The cap:** when the region's bone
 *   is not in `S` and `S` already holds the cap's count of bones, `S`'s
 *   lightest bone (its last) is dropped and the rest renormalised before the
 *   scaling, so g itself is never cut. **The floor:** the minimum weight is
 *   applied inside `S` (as today) and not again to the scaled shares — a
 *   share (1 − g)·S(b) under 0.03 is the declared falloff near the region, not
 *   noise to drop, and dropping it would put a step into the linear ramp.
 *   The rounding: see `roundShares` in `src/rig.ts`.
 *
 * ## Overlapping regions
 *
 * Refused where it would decide a weight: a vertex that two regions both give
 * g > 0 is named, with both regions and both g (`RIG_CONTOUR_REGIONS_OVERLAP`
 * in the rig stage). Rejected: (a) a geometric test that two supports
 * (region ∪ band) are disjoint — exact for two circles, but for a polygon the
 * band's outer edge is a curve at every convex corner, and comparing it with
 * another region is a sum of square roots, not decidable exactly on the grid;
 * (b) a combination (a sum renormalised when it passes 1, or the larger g) —
 * definable, but either rewrites the declared g = 1 inside one region wherever
 * another's band reaches it. The rule as tested is what the weights need:
 * each vertex holds one region's falloff. Two supports that overlap only
 * between vertices are not refused, and there the mesh interpolates between
 * vertices that each hold one region.
