/**
 * The two images See-through is fed, cut from the painting.
 *
 * - **full** — the painting centred on a WHITE square whose side is the
 *   painting's longer side (See-through's own pad is black, and a black margin
 *   reads to it as part of the figure): a portrait painting is padded left and
 *   right, a landscape one top and bottom, each by `squarePad`. The reference
 *   pasted at `((side - w) // 2, 0)` on a square of side `h`, which is centred
 *   only because its paintings are portrait; for those the vertical pad is 0
 *   and the bytes are the reference's. The pad is on See-through's input only:
 *   `proposeHeadBox` (`src/headbox.ts`) and `assemble` (`src/assemble.ts`) map
 *   the full run back through the same `squarePad`, x and y alike, so the rig
 *   stays in painting pixels with no padding in it.
 * - **head** — `seethrough.head_box` cut from the painting at its exact size.
 *   Written only when the config sets a head box; the config loader has
 *   already refused a box that is not a non-empty square.
 *
 * Pure raster. The reference converted the painting to RGB, which DROPS alpha
 * rather than compositing it — a translucent pixel would have kept whatever
 * colour sat under it. Neither dropping nor compositing is a value the input
 * states, so a painting with any pixel below alpha 255 is refused.
 *
 * Measured against the reference's own `st_input_full.png` and
 * `st_input_head.png` for the public examples: the selftest's
 * `inputs-examples` suite compares them pixel for pixel whenever
 * `bun run fetch-examples` has put them on disk.
