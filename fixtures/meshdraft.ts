/**
 * The mesh-draft fixture (issue #265): one tall flat strip on a three-link
 * chain, and a small block drawn as a region, so a rig builds, gates and
 * checks green and the figure is tall enough for the figure's rules to give a
 * spacing.
 *
 * ⭐ Nothing here is art. `strip` is an opaque 16x400 block, `mark` a 4x4 one.
 * No claim about appearance comes from them.
 *
 * ## The figure, by hand
 *
 * `mark` sits at (2, 2), 4x4; `strip` at (12, 10), 16x400. The union of the
 * boxes runs from row 2 to row 410, so **H = 408**: the tolerance and margin
 * T = max(1, round(408 / 554)) = max(1, 0) = **1**, and the spacing and the
 * longest outline edge S = round(408 / 37) = round(11.03) = **11**.
 *
 * ## The bones and the bend set
 *
 * `body` at (20, 10) under root; the chain `tail` under it through (20, 12),
 * (20, 145) and (20, 278) (the links a third of 400 apart, rounded), its tip at
 * (20, 408): **tail0, tail1, tail2**. The strip's segments name `tail`, so its
 * bend set turns all three links. `mark` is a region on `body`. The idle swings
 * the chain with amplitudes 1, 2 and 3 degrees, so `CHAIN_LAG` reads it and
 * `TEXTURE_STRETCH` reads the strip; no part is a topwear, eyewhite, handwear,
 * bottomwear, face or footwear, so the other judgement lines say SKIP.
 *
 * ## The three lattices
 *
 * The strip's lattice is the fixture's one free number. At grid 10 the gate
 * drafts the candidate (it holds every motion line and has fewer triangles).
 * At grid 12 the lattice has fewer triangles than the candidate, so reading 5
 * keeps it. At grid 8 the lattice is fine enough that the candidate's worst
 * sample at the bend set reads above the lattice's by more than a tenth.
 * Which one a control uses is said where it is used; no control reads a
 * figure off the readings but its verdict.

 * apart — on a rig 80 px wide:
 *
 * - `pins` at (40, 20), carried by **one** bone: its one segment runs along `pin` ([40, 24] → [70, 24]), so every
 *   lattice vertex is bound to `pin` alone and mesh-draft drafts the two blocks joined by a bridge.
 * - `studs` at (40, 60), carried by **two**: one segment on `stud_a` down the left block's left edge ([40, 60] →
 *   [40, 68]) and one on `stud_b` down the right block's right edge ([70, 60] → [70, 68]), r 4, so the lattice's
 *   vertices are bound to both bones and mesh-draft keeps the lattice, naming them.
 * - `specks` at (40, 100), 30x8, on `pin` too (issue #326, HQ's ruling on the speck): the 8x8 block at alpha 255 and
 *   a 2x3 speck at x 26..27, y 2..4 at **alpha 40** — 6 px, a real piece (more than 4 px), every pixel under 64: faint,
 *   so the draft leaves it out and its line names it. The pins beside it are the positive: their 6x8 block is visible
 *   and bridged although its bridge, across the 14 px left between the grown blocks, covers more than its 48 px.
 *
 * The figure does not move: the new boxes lie inside rows 20..108, within the union's rows 2..410, so H = 408,
 * T = 1 and S = 11 as {@link DRAFT_FIGURE} says. At T = 1 the blocks grow by one pixel each and stay 14 px apart, so
 * each image traces as two silhouettes. The lattices are at grid {@link DRAFT_ISLANDS_GRID}, finer than the
 * candidate is coarse; no control reads a figure off the lattice but the verdict and the note.
