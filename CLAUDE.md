# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI-assisted sessions working on this repository. `AGENTS.md` is a
link to this file.

## What this is

spine-parts takes one anime character painting and its
[See-through](https://github.com/shitagaki-lab/see-through) layer decomposition
and produces Spine-ready parts — `parts/*.png`, `parts.json` (per-part
provenance and measurements), and `rig.json` / `motion.json` in
[rig-c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc)'s spec — then calls rig-c to
compile, gate, render and check. It is a port of a working reference
implementation that lives in a private repository (see *Where the private
oracle lives*). Version 0.1.0 carries every stage — layers, sheet, assemble,
propose, rig, check, loop — and `build`, which runs assemble, rig and check in
one process (`src/build.ts`); the optional ComfyUI adapter is the one command
still registered as not implemented.

## The doctrine: a tool for AI, not for people

An agent building a character rig from a painting cannot see the painting, the
layers or the result. A pipeline that only reports "done" lets it report
success on a broken rig and be sincere about it. spine-parts exists, like
rig-c under it, to convert that silence into named failures.

- **The messages are the UI.** A refusal names the rule, the object, the value
  found and the value required: `LAYERS_PNG_MATCHES_BBOX: layer "face" —
  parts/face.png is 25x12; the manifest box is 26x12`. "invalid layer" is not a
  message this repository writes. Readers collect every problem and throw once,
  so one run names everything that is wrong.
- **Everything resolves by name, and a miss is refused by name.** A bone's
  parent, a mesh's segment bones, a region's bone, a plan part's tag, an
  `extend_below_crop` part, a track's bone or chain. Parents come before
  children, as Spine requires.
- **Never invent a value.** No defaults guessed from the art, no "reasonable"
  fallbacks for a missing field, no silent mapping of an unknown tag to a
  nearby one. A missing number is a refusal naming the field. Where the
  reference implementation silently truncated or guessed (amplitudes zipped
  against chain links, a sine period that does not divide the idle, a
  non-square head box scaled by its width), the loader refuses.
- **Emit only after green.** A stage writes its outputs only when every check
  it owns has passed, and the rig stages write only after rig-c's round
  trip has passed. A wrong file on disk outlives the console that warned about
  it.
- 🔒 **rig-c's gate is not optional here either.** spine-parts does not
  emit Spine data itself; it hands a rig spec to rig-c, whose `build`
  validates before it writes. Which validator runs is rigc's launcher's
  choice, by whether `@esotericsoftware/spine-core` resolves beside it: the
  spine-core round trip where it does, rigc's own validator over the compiled
  model document where it does not, and the report's last lines say which
  ran. In this repository and its CI the runtime is a development
  dependency, so the round trip runs here; an install of spine-parts carries
  no Spine runtime and runs rigc's own gate, and `check.json` records which
  gated the build. `build`'s gate is the one gate: rigc runs it once over the
  compile and once over the packed pages on disk, under `spine-html`, which
  holds every rule `spine` measures (selftest `CH09`), so no stage runs a
  second `rigc validate`. There must never be a path in this package that
  produces skeleton data without that gate, nor a flag or environment escape
  that skips it, and nothing here re-implements what rigc validates.
- **Determinism is a contract.** The same inputs write the same bytes: fixed
  key order in every JSON written, stable sorts, no clock, no randomness, no
  locale-sensitive formatting. `src/` is pure except `src/comfy/` (below).
- **A gate nobody has seen fail is not a gate.** Every check in `selftest.ts`
  has a planted input that must make it fire, next to the positive control that
  must not. A suite with nothing to read reports **SKIP** and a HOLE line,
  never a pass.
- **No `any`, no `as any`, in `src/` or `cli.ts`.** `bun run lint` enforces it,
  and `TY01` checks that any exemption in `selftest.ts` sits between an
  `eslint-disable`/`eslint-enable` pair (there is none today).
- **Numbers carry their source.** A figure in a comment or a document is
  measured (and says against what — "bit-exact against cv2 4.13 over N
  samples") or it is not written. An unmeasured doubt is not written either.
- **The scene belongs to the consumer.** What the rig can do — its sway, its
  breath, its blink — is ours; when it does it, and with what else on screen,
  is not.

### The same lens governs how the repository is worked

Questions that look like preferences — which reading, which name, which
threshold — are settled by what is derivable and measurable, not by asking a
person. What survives that lens is short: direction, licence posture, what the
spend is worth, and text that speaks as the owner. "I cannot tell" is not a
reason to escalate; it means an instrument is missing, and the answer is a
check or a card. A task brief is checked against the tree before it is trusted,
and a report says what in the brief was contradicted.

The reader to write for is an agent with no memory of the conversation that
produced the work: a decision not written into the tree did not happen. Commit
messages and pull requests carry the argument — the claim, its measurement, and
the alternative rejected with the reason.

## Where the private oracle lives and what may not cross

The port is verified against the reference implementation and its corpus — real
paintings, their See-through runs, the parts and configs the reference produced
— which live in a **private** repository and **never enter this tree**.

- ⛔ No painting, layer PNG, part PNG, `layers.json`, `parts.json`, `config.json`
  or rig from that corpus is copied here, in whole or in part, including as a
  fixture or a test expectation.
- ⛔ No character name from that corpus appears in any file. The one place the
  names are written is the marked block in `selftest.ts`, which exists so `TY04`
  can refuse them everywhere else.
- ⛔ No LAN address (`TY03`), no Korean text (`TY02`): the repository is English
  only, and a host is the user's, supplied at run time.
- ✅ The corpus is **read** with `bun run selftest -- --corpus <dir>` (or
  `SPINE_PARTS_CORPUS=<dir>`), which reads every `layers.json` and `parts.json`
  under it and writes nothing. A named corpus that does not exist exits 2; no
  corpus is a SKIP and a HOLE, never a pass.
- ✅ Measurements taken against it may be quoted as figures ("18 of 18 layer
  sets read green"), never as content.
- The fixtures that DO live here (`fixtures/synthetic.ts`) are flat colour
  blocks with hand-computable counts, and no claim about appearance is made
  from them.
- ✅ **The public examples are not that corpus.** `examples/<key>/` holds
  characters generated to be published — a public checkpoint, no identity
  LoRA, no private character text; the generation record and the licence are
  in the [spine-parts-examples](https://github.com/firejune/spine-parts-examples)
  repository. Their config, proposal, contact sheets and the reference's
  outputs (`expected/`) are tracked here — for `scarf`, which no reference
  ever ran, `expected/` is this port's own build at the commit that added
  it, so its chain suite holds the tree to itself; the painting and the See-through
  layers are fetched by `bun run fetch-examples`, at the commit that script
  pins, into the gitignored `examples/*/inputs`. The rules above are about
  where a file came from, not what it is called: a `config.json` or
  `parts.json` belongs here exactly when its character was made public on
  purpose, and the forbidden-name scan (`TY04`) covers `examples/` like every
  other tracked file.

## Conventions

- Bun + TypeScript, ESM, `.ts` extensions in relative imports, `strict: true`.
- `src/` is pure: no clock, no randomness, no network, no child processes.
  **One** directory is the exception, `src/comfy/`, reserved for the optional
  ComfyUI adapter; `TY06` scans every other file under `src/`.
- **The y flip has one door.** Parts and configs are in crop pixels, y down,
  origin top-left; Spine's world is y up. The conversion is rig-c's
  (`rig-c/src/transform.ts`), re-exported by `src/coords.ts`, and `TY07`
  refuses any other importer. Do not open-code `height - y` anywhere.
- **rig-c's deep paths are an interface.** rig-c's `exports` map
  carries `./*.ts`, so `rig-c/tools/plate.ts` (PNG codec),
  `rig-c/src/png.ts`, `rig-c/tools/font5x7.ts` and
  `rig-c/src/transform.ts` are imported by path. The mesh functions come
  through the named entry `rig-c/mesh` (from 2.16.0): the outline
  functions `src/contour.ts` reuses, every one on the entry's promised list,
  and `reduceMesh` with its `mesh-quality-report/1` types (2.19.0), which
  `src/automesh.ts` calls. A rig-c release that moves them, or narrows
  the map, breaks this package by name, and `bun run smoke` is where that
  shows first.
- **Raster ops state which call they stand in for.** Each function in
  `src/raster/` names the OpenCV / SciPy / PIL call whose semantics it
  reproduces and what was measured against it; a known deviation is written in
  the doc comment, not hidden.
- **Do not name a function `declare`.** Bun strips a statement `declare(...)`
  as a TypeScript ambient declaration while tsc accepts it as a call; `TY08`
  holds the tree to it.
- A new runtime import that crosses a directory must be inside `files` in
  `package.json`. `npm pack --dry-run` lists what ships; no document keeps that
  list by hand.
- Conventional Commits, English subject and body. Pushing, tagging and
  publishing are the owner's call.

## Verification — run these before you call a unit finished

| Command | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` over the paths `tsconfig.json`'s `include` names |
| `bun run lint` | one rule: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` as an error |
| `bun run selftest` | every suite's positive and negative controls on generated fixtures, and the tree rules; `-- --corpus <dir>`, or fetched `examples/*/inputs` (`bun run fetch-examples`), adds the read-only corpus suite |
| `bun run smoke` | the **package** rather than the tree: pack, install into an empty directory, run `--version`, the installed `rigc --version` (the core entry), `layers` (wrapper and PSD), `sheet` and `check` on a generated rig from the install, with four planted broken packages that must go red. Needs a network |

## The selftest and its fixtures

`bun run selftest` is self-contained: no arguments, no art, no network, no
private repository. The rules that hold it together:

- **The run counts itself off the lines it prints.** Every suite is wrapped by
  `RunTally.of`; its figure is the number of `PASS`/`FAIL` case lines it
  printed, its own positive control included. Nothing is typed into the summary
  — `TY09` refuses a digit in the summary's text and a constant only the summary
  reads.
- **The floor is per suite.** A suite that ran and printed no case, a suite
  opening more or fewer than one section, a case line outside every suite, an
  unknown gutter word, a returned failure count that disagrees with the printed
  FAIL lines — each is a fault, and a run with a fault exits **2**. `RT01`–`RT05`
  plant each one.
- **Suites run in workers, and are printed and counted in order.** Each suite
  runs in a process of its own (`selftest.ts --suite-worker <key>`), several at
  once; the parent replays each one's lines through the same tally, in the
  `SUITES` order, so the case lines are a sequential run's. A suite therefore
  shares nothing with another at run time — no module state, no file outside
  its own temp directory. A worker that cannot account for its suite is that
  suite's `SUITE_CRASHED` FAIL (`RT06`); the suites tallied are held to
  `SUITES`, every one once and in order (`RT08`). Only `run-tally` runs in the
  parent, last, because it reads the live tally.
- **An absent input is a HOLE.** The corpus suite with neither a named corpus
  nor any fetched `examples/*/inputs` opens its section, prints `SKIP` and a HOLE line, counts as not run, and the summary
  names it.
- **No expectation is a number measured off private data.** Every expected
  value in a control is computed by hand from the fixture or from a definition
  (the Lanczos control evaluates the filter in float64); figures measured
  against the private corpus or against cv2/PIL appear only in `origin:` prose.
- **The tree population is read off the disk**, not off git: every file outside
  `.git` and `.gitignore`, so the rules hold before the first commit as well as
  after. `TY00` holds that walk to the tree, and refuses `.gitignore` syntax its
  small matcher does not implement.
